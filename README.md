<!-- HOW IT WORKS -->
## How it Works

I made a JSON with 408 quotes, the quotes were taken from here: https://www.oberlo.com/blog/motivational-quotes.
When the component is mounted it fetch the JSON and converts it to an array, the array is set inside the state, when you click on a new quote it changes the index in the state to a random number and then another quote is displayed.
You get a different quote every time!

### Running the code

*   Navigate to the root directory of the project

*   Run this command on your terminal to run the code locally on http://localhost:3000:
    ```
    $ npm start
    ```
*   Also you can build this app for production, react are going to make a build folder with minified files, and filenames with hashes for best performance
    ```
    $ npm build
    ```
*   You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

* To learn React, check out the [React documentation](https://reactjs.org/).
